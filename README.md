(https://github.com/83Gh0st/blog-of-the-future/blob/main/2024-12-24_17-40.png?raw=true)
This documentation provides a step-by-step guide for setting up, configuring, and deploying the blog application described in the video tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/pfHjxyeCHRs?list=PLs0RSZipvGCQlfdgzb1o6ijSIHJ3Axq1z). The guide covers both major and minor configurations required to run the application successfully.

---

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (Atlas or local installation)
- **Git**
- **A code editor** (e.g., VS Code)

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
or, if you prefer yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
2. Add the following variables, replacing `<values>` with your actual configurations:

   ```plaintext
   DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/<database_name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_api_key>"
   ```

3. **Important:** Never commit the `.env` file to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore`.

---

## Step 4: Set Up MongoDB

1. If you are using **MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Sign up at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and create a cluster.
   - Create a database and note the connection string (used in the `DATABASE_URL`).

2. If you are using **local MongoDB**:
   - Install MongoDB locally by following the [official guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/).
   - Update the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with your local MongoDB URL (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name`).

---

## Step 5: Configure OpenAI API

1. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and generate an API key.
2. Add the key to your `.env` file:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY="<your_openai_api_key>"
   ```
3. Ensure you have sufficient quota in your OpenAI account.

---

## Step 6: Configure Next.js Routes

### API Routes

- The application uses custom API routes for creating posts, fetching posts, and interacting with the OpenAI API.
- Verify that all API endpoints are correctly implemented under the `src/app/api` folder.

### Example Endpoints:
- **POST** `/api/posts` - Creates a new post.
- **GET** `/api/posts` - Fetches all posts.

---

## Step 7: Start the Application

To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Step 8: Testing the Application

1. Create a new post:
   - Ensure your OpenAI API integration is working by creating a post with AI-generated content.
2. Fetch existing posts:
   - Check if posts are displayed correctly on the homepage.

### Debugging Tips:
- If you encounter a `500` error, check the API logs in your terminal.
- Verify the MongoDB connection string in your `.env` file.
- Ensure your OpenAI API key has sufficient quota.

---

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel:
1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and import your GitHub repository.
3. Add the environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy the application.

### Deploy to Other Platforms:
- Ensure the deployment platform supports Next.js and Node.js.
- Configure environment variables appropriately.

---

## Additional Configuration Details

### ESLint and Prettier
- This project includes ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting. You can customize their configurations by editing the `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc` files located in the root directory. For instance, you can adjust rules, enable/disable specific checks, or set formatting preferences such as indentation style and line width. Refer to the official [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/configuring/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) documentation for further guidance.
- To check for linting errors, run:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

### Logging
- The application logs errors to the terminal for debugging. Ensure `console.error` is used judiciously in production.

### Rate Limiting
- Add rate limiting for your API endpoints to prevent misuse of OpenAI API quota.
